# Sign-up form

A project from [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)'s curriculum. The goal is to create a simple sign-up form.

This project helped me reinforce the concepts I'd learned about HTML and CSS, especially form validation and styling.
